An SPDX document typically describes one or more software \"packages\", which may or may not contain files or reference other packages through various types of relationships. Because all documents, files, and packages are represented with URIs, it is easy to use SPDX to describe relationships among packages and files from across the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Project Description\r\n\r\nSpdXtra is a Java API for building and analyzing SPDX for large codebases. Unlike SPDXtools, the document model is not built or kept in memory.\r\n\r\nAt present, the API is sufficient to create minimal SPDX 2.1 and 2.0 documents, but it is not yet feature-complete. Examples of some of SpdXtra's possibilities may be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/yevster/spdxtraxample).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the command line tool can be used to convert SPDX from RDF form to JSON-LD - if that's your desire.\r\n\r\n##So how does it work?\r\n\r\nSpdXtra is designed to perform tractibly when generating or analyzing SPDX for very large codebases (hundreds of thousands of files).\r\n\r\nAt its core, SpdXtra is a library static (as in \"completely stateless\") SPDX-specific operations to populate and access a TDB dataset.. It has two top-level classes with static methods:\r\n\r\n`Read` - Return immutable views over specific SPDX elements and to output the datastore to a file.\r\n\r\n`Write` - To generate SPDX-specific inserts and updates to the dataset and apply them in a transactional way. Grouping updates into transactions can ensure atomicity of multiple updates to the same element and improved performance (multiple updates on the same resource can be persisted at once).\r\n\r\n##Limitations (important!)\r\n\r\nThe TDB datastore used by SpdXtra may not be used concurrently by multiple processes.\r\n\r\n##License\r\n\r\nThis product is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.\r\n\r\nAll documents produced by this product are licensed under the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal license, per Section 2 of the SPDX Specification.\r\n",
